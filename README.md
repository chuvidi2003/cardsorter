Welcome to cardSORTER Beta!
===================

cardSORTER is a web based tool being developed to implement the cardsorting methodology frequently used in social science research .  Potential applications of this tool will be in :

- **Construct Cardsorting** : Sorting items into multiple constructs to verify initial content validity.
- **Qualitative Text Coding** : Assigning qualitative text data (e.g interview text, forum text data, other things) into defined category.

**Update** The initial version of the app was done in PHP (old files [here](/old)), but I am currently rewriting the app to work with nodejs. Some rationale behind this [here.](https://github.com/victordibia/cardsorter/issues/2)

Why create cardSORTER
-------
I considered creating cardSORTER because I could not find any free tool that allowed me to easily code a large number of items and also allow for multiple coders. Other things cardSORTER has going (or will have) includes it being ..
- Free
- Easy to Use
- Web-based (multi-user support)
- Report Generation and Data Export
- Cognitive Service Integration (think comparing machine based coding with )
