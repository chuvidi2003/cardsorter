Why create cardSORTER
-------
I considered creating cardSORTER because I could not find any free tool that allowed me to easily code a large number of items and also allow for multiple coders. Other things cardSORTER has going (or will have) includes it being ..
- Free
- Easy to Use
- Web-based (multi-user support)
- Report Generation and Data Export
