						  <p class="page-header">What is CARD SORTING </p>
								 
						  <p>cardSORTER is an online tool in beta stage development to simplify the research process of CARD SORTING that pretty much originates from the field of psychology. Though similar, this process is fairly different from the cardsorting process used to group and layout content for user interface research. To elaborate,</p>
						  <p>Card sorting “involves [the] sorting [of] a series of cards, each labeled with a piece of content or 
						    functionality, into groups that make sense to users or participants” (Mauer &amp; Warfel, 2002, p.2). 
						    Closed sorting is defined as “[a methodology] in which the groupings are defined by the researcher 
						    and the subject is putting object cards into the defined groups” (Deaton, 2002, p.4). Open sorting is 
						    defined as “[a methodology] in which subjects can determine their own groupings by first sorting <br />
					      the cards and then labeling the resulting piles” (Deaton, 2002, p.4).</p>
