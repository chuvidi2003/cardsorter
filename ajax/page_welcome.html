						  <p>cardSORTER is an online tool in beta stage development to simplify the research process of CARD SORTING that pretty much originates from the field of psychology. Though similar, this process is fairly different from the cardsorting process used to group and layout content for user interface research. To elaborate,</p>
                          <blockquote>
						   Card sorting “involves [the] sorting [of] a series of cards, each labeled with a piece of content or 
						    functionality, into groups that make sense to users or participants” (Mauer &amp; Warfel, 2002, p.2).  </blockquote>
						     <strong>Closed sorting</strong> is defined as “[a methodology] in which the groupings are defined by the researcher 
						    and the subject is putting object cards into the defined groups” (Deaton, 2002, p.4). <strong>Open sorting</strong> is 
						    defined as “[a methodology] in which subjects can determine their own groupings by first sorting 
					      the cards and then labeling the resulting piles” (Deaton, 2002, p.4). cardSORTER is being built to support both open and closed sorting.

						  <p>To participate in the cardSorting process, follow 3 simple steps</p>
						  <ol>
						    <li>Read coding instructions </li>
						    <li>Use the training tab to get familiar with the coding process. Once you;ve achieved decent competency, you can head over to the start</li>
